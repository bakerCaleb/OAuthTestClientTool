OAuthTestClientTool
===================

A test client that can be used with Azure AD and AD, to test their OAuth 2.0 authorization_code implementations.

This is currenlty a very simple tool that can be used to see the request and response OAuth 2.0 messages, used by Azure Active Dirctory and ADFS. It does not implement all of the features that would be required of a production OAuth 2.0 client, so should only be used as informational.
